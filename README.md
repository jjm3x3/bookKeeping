This is a simple bookKeeping app that I built for personal use.

It has a pretty simple interface with very few features.

To start the app simply run bookKeeping.bat

You can 'manage' Accounts:
adding them and setting their starting balance

You can add transactions:
they will have a name, amount, and date and will automatically be applied to the account balance for which they are for
create a transaction for an account by making sure the account is highlighted in the list and then click add transaction

To see a list of transactions for any given account double click on the account in the account listing.

all amounts are assumed to be positive if you wish to make a transaction against  your account make it a negative one.
